/**
 * @brief represents the PIB
 *
 * The PIB (Public Information Base) stores the public portion of a user's cryptography keys.
 * The format and location of stored information is indicated by the PibLocator.
 * The PIB is designed to work with a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) which stores private keys.
 * There is a one-to-one association between PIB and TPM, and therefore the TpmLocator is recorded
 * by the PIB to enforce this association and prevent one from operating on mismatched PIB and TPM.
 *
 * Information in the PIB is organized in a hierarchy of Identity-Key-Certificate. At the top level,
 * the Pib class provides access to identities, and allows setting a default identity. Properties of
 * an identity can be accessed after obtaining an Identity object.
 *
 * @note Pib instance is created and managed only by KeyChain. KeyChain::getPib() returns
 *       a const reference to the managed Pib instance, through which it is possible to
 *       retrieve information about identities, keys, and certificates.
 *
 * @throw PibImpl::Error when underlying implementation has non-semantic error.
