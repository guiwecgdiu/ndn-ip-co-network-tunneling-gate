/** \brief Priority FIFO replacement policy
 *
 *  This policy maintains a set of cleanup queues to decide the eviction order of CS entries.
 *  The cleanup queues are three doubly linked lists that store EntryRefs.
 *  The three queues keep track of unsolicited, stale, and fresh Data packet, respectively.
 *  EntryRef is placed into, removed from, and moved between suitable queues
 *  whenever an Entry is added, removed, or has other attribute changes.
 *  Each Entry should be in exactly one queue at any moment.
 *  Within each queue, the EntryRefs are kept in first-in-first-out order.
 *  Eviction procedure exhausts the first queue before moving onto the next queue,
 *  in the order of unsolicited, stale, and fresh queue.
