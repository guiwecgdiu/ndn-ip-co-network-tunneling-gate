[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/named-data-ndnSIM/ndnSIM.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/named-data-ndnSIM/ndnSIM)

A new release of [NS-3 based Named Data Networking (NDN) simulator](http://ndnsim.net/)
went through extensive refactoring and rewriting.  The key new features of the new
version:

- [NDN Packet Specification](http://named-data.net/doc/NDN-packet-spec/current/)

- ndnSIM uses implementation of basic NDN primitives from
  [ndn-cxx library (NDN C++ library with eXperimental eXtensions)](http://named-data.net/doc/ndn-cxx/)

  Based on version `0.7.0`

- All NDN forwarding and management is implemented directly using source code of
  [Named Data Networking Forwarding Daemon (NFD)](http://named-data.net/doc/NFD/)

  Based on version `0.7.0`

- Allows [simulation of real applications](http://ndnsim.net/guide-to-simulate-real-apps.html)
  written against ndn-cxx library

- Requires a modified version of NS-3 based on version `ns-3.30.1`
