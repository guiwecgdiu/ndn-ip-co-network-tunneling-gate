Obtaining metrics
=================

To obtain simulation results, you would need to connect to one or more `trace sources <doxygen/group___trace_source_list.html>`_ provided by ndnSIM classes.

It is also possible to use existing trace helpers, which collects and aggregates requested statistical information in text files.

.. _trace classes:

Packet-level trace helpers
--------------------------

- :ndnsim:`ndn::L3RateTracer`

    Tracing the rate in bytes and in number of packets of Interest/Data packets forwarded by an NDN node

    The following example enables tracing on all simulation nodes:

    .. code-block:: c++

        // the following should be put just before calling Simulator::Run in the scenario

        L3RateTracer::InstallAll("rate-trace.txt", Seconds(1.0));

        Simulator::Run();

        ...

- :ndnsim:`L2Tracer`

    This tracer is similar in spirit to :ndnsim:`ndn::L3RateTracer`, but it currently traces only packet drop on layer 2 (e.g.,
    due to transmission queue overflow).

    The following example enables tracing on all simulation nodes:

    .. code-block:: c++

        // the following should be put just before calling Simulator::Run in the scenario

        L2RateTracer::InstallAll("drop-trace.txt", Seconds(0.5));

        Simulator::Run();

.. note::

    A number of other tracers are available in ``plugins/tracers-broken`` folder, but they do not yet work with the current code.
    Eventually, we will port most of them to the current code, but it is not our main priority at the moment and would really appreciate help with writing new tracers and porting the old ones.

.. - Tracing lifetime of content store entries

..     Evaluate lifetime of the content store entries can be accomplished using modified version of the content stores.
..     In particular,

.. _cs trace helper example:

Example of content store trace helper
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This example (``ndn-tree-cs-tracers.cpp``) demonstrates basic usage of content store tracer.

In this scenario we will use the same tree-like topology as in :ref:`previous example <packet trace helper example>`, where consumers are installed on leaf nodes and producer is in the root of the tree.
The main difference is that each client request data from the same namespace: /root/1, /root/2, ...  Another small difference is that in this scenario we start our application not at the same time, but 10 ms apart.

Example simulation (``ndn-tree-cs-tracers.cpp``) scenario that utilizes trace helpers:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/ndn-tree-cs-tracers.cpp
    :language: c++
    :linenos:
    :lines: 20-27,60-
    :emphasize-lines: 61


To run this scenario, use the following command::

        ./waf --run=ndn-tree-cs-tracers

The successful run will create ``cs-trace.txt``, which similarly to trace file from the :ref:`tracing example <packet trace helper example>` can be analyzed manually or used as input to some graph/stats packages.

.. _app delay trace helper example:

Example of application-level trace helper
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This example (``ndn-tree-app-delay-tracer.cpp``) demonstrates basic usage of application-level Interest-Data delay tracer.

In this scenario we will use the same tree-like topology as in :ref:`packet trace helper example <packet trace helper example>`, where consumers are installed on leaf nodes and producer is in the root of the tree and clients request data from the same namespace: /root/1, /root/2, ...

Example simulation (``ndn-tree-app-delay-tracer.cpp``) scenario that utilizes trace helpers:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/ndn-tree-app-delay-tracer.cpp
    :language: c++
    :linenos:
    :lines: 20-27,60-
    :emphasize-lines: 60

To run this scenario, use the following command::

        ./waf --run=ndn-tree-app-delay-tracer

The successful run will create ``app-delays-trace.txt``, which similarly to trace file from the
:ref:`packet trace helper example <packet trace helper example>` can be analyzed manually or used as
input to some graph/stats packages.
